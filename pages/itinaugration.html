                <p>On September 21, 2024, our department celebrated the inauguration of both the IT Forum and our new
                    department website. Dr. Shreesha Bhat graced the event as the Chief Guest, with Pro Alex Ivan Sequra
                    presiding as the Forum President. The IT Forum was launched through an innovative IoT project
                    demonstration, underscoring our commitment to leveraging technology in meaningful ways. The
                    department website will serve as a digital platform to keep our community informed, connected, and
                    engaged. Together, these initiatives aim to foster collaboration, enhance learning, and spotlight
                    advancements in information technology.</p>

                    The IT Forum was introduced with an engaging demonstration of an IoT project, highlighting the
                    potential of smart technology to address real-world challenges. This project embodied the
                    departmentâ€™s vision for applied learning and innovation, illustrating how Internet of Things (IoT)
                    devices can streamline everyday processes and transform traditional industries. By launching the
                    forum with such a project, the department emphasized its mission to go beyond theoretical knowledge,
                    promoting a hands-on approach that prepares students for the demands of a rapidly evolving tech
                    landscape. Moving forward, the IT Forum will serve as a dynamic platform where students can delve
                    into cutting-edge topics and engage directly with technology experts through a variety of seminars,
                    workshops, and events.

                    As an interactive hub, the IT Forum aims to be a central space for students, faculty, and industry
                    professionals to come together, share ideas, and explore emerging trends in IT. By creating a
                    regular schedule of discussions and presentations, the forum will bridge the gap between academia
                    and industry, helping students stay updated on the skills and insights needed to excel in tech
                    careers. Through the IT Forum, students will have the chance to participate in real-world projects,
                    connect with alumni, and deepen their understanding of industry-relevant topics, from artificial
                    intelligence and data science to cybersecurity and beyond. This initiative will not only enrich
                    their academic journey but also enhance their preparedness for future roles as innovators and
                    leaders in technology.

                    Complementing the IT Forum, our newly launched department website will act as a digital platform to
                    keep our academic community informed, connected, and engaged. Designed with user experience in mind,
                    the website will provide easy access to information about upcoming events, departmental news, and
                    educational resources. More than just a news portal, it will highlight the achievements of our
                    students and faculty, feature a repository of research publications, and host announcements
                    regarding student projects and internships. Together, the IT Forum and the department website are
                    poised to transform how our community collaborates, learns, and celebrates advancements in
                    information technology, marking a significant step forward in our commitment to a vibrant and
                    connected educational environment.
